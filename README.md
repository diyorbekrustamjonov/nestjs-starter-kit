# Typescript Template

This repository provides a TypeScript template with preconfigured packages for ESLint, Prettier, and Jest. It offers a solid foundation for your project development, ensuring code quality, consistency, and reliable testing.

## Features

- TypeScript setup
- ESLint for code linting and style enforcement
- Prettier for code formatting
- Jest for automated testing

## Getting Started

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Start the application: `npm start`

## Scripts

- `npm run build`: Deletes the `build` directory, compiles the TypeScript code, and generates type aliases.
- `npm start`: Runs the built application from the `build` directory.
- `npm run lint:tslint`: Lints the TypeScript code using TSLint and automatically fixes issues.
- `npm run lint:prettier`: Formats the TypeScript code using Prettier.

- `npm run coverage`: Generates test coverage reports using Istanbul/NYC.

## Usage

1. Modify and add your TypeScript files in the appropriate directories.
2. Customize ESLint rules and configurations in the `.eslintrc.js` file.
3. Adjust Prettier settings in the `.prettierrc.js` file.
